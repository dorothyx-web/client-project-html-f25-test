                <p>Start any interview (at any stage) strongly by highlighting your achievements and telling a comprehensive personal story concisely.</p>
                <p>TMAY ("Tell Me About Yourself") is one of the most frequently asked questions in interviews, and it is generally the first question posed. Your response should highlight your educational, technical, or business-related achievements.</p>
                <p>It is expected (and reasonable) to reference previous application materials such as your resume or cover letter. However, responses should be tailored to emphasize how you will meet the organization’s needs—each interview should be slightly different.</p>
                <p>Think of this answer as an extended version of an elevator pitch and a preview of the rest of the interview. Ask yourself: What key messages do you want to convey about your ability to succeed in the role and your interest in it?</p>

                Course projects vary by academic focus—below are tailored TMAY examples for three common UMSI tracks (UX Design, Information Analysis, Data Science). These examples highlight how to align project details with industry-specific roles, making your narrative more relevant to recruiters.

                <h4>UX Design Track (Target Role: UX Design Intern)</h4>
                <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666; margin-bottom: 15px;">"Hi, I’m Zoe Kim—I’m a junior in UMSI’s Information Science program with a focus on UX Design, and I’m excited to share how my course projects align with your intern role."</p>
                <p>
                    Last semester, I took "Intro to UX Design" and worked on a client-based course project for GLANSIS, a local environmental organization. Their website was outdated and hard for users to find conservation resources, so my task was to redesign the site’s information architecture and create high-fidelity prototypes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started by conducting 8 user interviews to identify pain points—users mentioned struggling to navigate the "Volunteer Opportunities" section—and created user personas to guide design decisions. Using Figma, I developed 3 wireframe iterations, then ran usability tests with 6 participants to refine the prototype. I also collaborated with the GLANSIS team to ensure the design matched their brand guidelines—this meant adjusting color schemes and typography to align with their mission of environmental advocacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final deliverable was a fully interactive Figma prototype and a 10-page design brief explaining my process. The GLANSIS director told me they plan to use my prototype to secure funding for the website redesign. This project taught me how to balance user needs with client goals— a skill I know is critical for your UX Design Intern role, where you mention collaborating with product teams to iterate on designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm particularly drawn to your company's focus on accessible design—during the GLANSIS project, I ensured all text met WCAG contrast standards and added screen reader compatibility notes. I’m eager to bring this user-centric, accessible mindset to your team and learn from your work on consumer app design.

                <h4>Information Analysis Track (Target Role: Business Intelligence Intern)</h4>
                <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666; margin-bottom: 15px;">"Hello, I'm Raj Patel—I'm a senior in UMSI’s Information Analysis program, and I want to share how my course projects have prepared me for your Business Intelligence Intern role."</p>
                <p>
                    This semester, I'm enrolled in "Information Analysis for Organizations," where my team and I worked on a project for a local small business association. The association wanted to understand why 30% of their member businesses had not renewed their memberships, so we were tasked with analyzing survey data and presenting actionable recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I led the data cleaning phase—we had 500+ survey responses with missing values and inconsistent formatting—using Excel and SQL to standardize the data. Then, I used Tableau to create visualizations: a heatmap showing which membership benefits were least used, and a bar chart comparing renewal rates by business size. I also conducted a thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses, identifying "lack of networking opportunities" as a top complaint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We presented our findings to the association's board, and they approved a pilot program for monthly virtual networking events based on our recommendation. This project taught me how to translate raw data into business insights—exactly what your intern role entails, as you mentioned supporting the BI team in creating client reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also proficient in Tableau, which your job description lists as a required skill. During the project, I created dynamic dashboards that let the association filter data by business type—this experience will help me contribute quickly to your team’s work on retail client analytics.

                <p>
                    Last semester, I took "Natural Language Processing for Health Data," where I worked on a course project focused on social media mining for healthcare applications. The goal was to classify 25,672 tweets about medication adverse reactions into 5 categories (e.g., "side effect: nausea," "dosage issue")—a task that mirrored real-world pharmacovigilance work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started by preprocessing the text data: removing stopwords, tokenizing tweets, and using word embeddings to convert text into numerical features. Then, I implemented two models in Python: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After hyperparameter tuning (using GridSearchCV), the CNN achieved an F1 Score of 0.53—only 0.07 lower than the expert researcher baseline. I also wrote a 15-page report explaining my methodology and comparing model performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project taught me how to apply NLP techniques to health data, which aligns with your intern role's focus on analyzing patient feedback for pharmaceutical clients. Your job description also mentions using Python for model development—during the project, I used libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and NLTK, which I know your team uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also passionate about ethical AI—during the project, I checked for bias in the training data (e.g., overrepresentation of tweets from younger users) and adjusted the model to be more inclusive. I’m eager to bring this ethical mindset to your team’s work, as you prioritize responsible data science in your company values.

            <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Course projects are your secret weapon:</b> For students without internships, they're the most relevant way to showcase skills—use the ACR/STAR frameworks to structure details clearly.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Transparency is critical:</b> Always label projects as "course," "capstone," or "client-based academic" work—never misrepresent them as paid jobs, especially for immigration compliance.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Align with the role:</b> Tailor your TMAY to the job description—highlight course project skills that match the employer's needs (e.g., Figma for UX roles, Python for data roles).</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Practice makes perfect:</b> Use CDO drop-ins, mock interviews, and peer groups to refine your narrative—feedback will help you make course projects sound more impactful.</li>
                <li><b>Leverage UMSI resources:</b> The CDO Canvas site, CareerLink, and January career fair prep workshops are designed to help you succeed—take advantage of them!</li>
            </ul>

                Your TMAY is the first step to showing employers you're the right fit—with course projects at the center, you'll stand out in every interview!
